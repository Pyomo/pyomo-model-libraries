#   Source: This problem is associated to the family of Hard-Spheres 
#   problem. It belongs to the family of sphere packing problems, a 
#   class of challenging problems dating from the beginning of the 
#   17th century which is related to practical problems in Chemistry, 
#   Biology and Physics. It consists on maximizing the minimum pairwise 
#   distance between NP points on a sphere in \R^{MDIM}. 
#   This problem may be reduced to a nonconvex nonlinear optimization 
#   problem with a potentially large number of (nonoptimal) points 
#   satisfying optimality conditions. We have, thus, a class of problems 
#   indexed by the parameters MDIM and NP, that provides a suitable 
#   set of test problems for evaluating nonlinear programming codes.
#   After some algebraic manipulations, we can formulate this problem as
#
#                            Minimize z
#
#                            subject to
#       
#      z \geq <x_i, x_j> for all different pair of indices i, j
#      
#                            ||x_i||^2 = 1    for all i = 1,...,NP
#
#     The goal is to find an objective value less than 0.5 (This means
#     that the NP points stored belong to the sphere and every distance
#     between two of them is greater than 1.0).
#
#     Obs: the starting point is aleatorally chosen although each 
#     variable belongs to [-1.,1.].
