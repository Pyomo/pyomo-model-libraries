#
#   The lubricant film gap and pressure between two lubricated
#   elastic cylinders in line contact is calculated.  When the pressure
#   is positive, Reynolds' equation applies and must be satisfied;
#   when the pressure is 0, the surfaces must diverge.
#
#   The load (in pounds) is represented by alpha.
#   The speed (in rpm) of the cylinders is represented by lambda. 
#   (alpha, lambda) pairs are given in the tables alph and lam, respectively.
