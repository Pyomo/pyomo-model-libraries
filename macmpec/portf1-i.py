# portfl-i.py  QLR2-AY-NLP-87-25-12
# Pyomo coding by William Hart
# Adapted from AMPL coding by Sven Leyffer, Feb. 2001,
# from portfl models of Bob Vanderbei.

# A QPEC obtained by varying the grad of portfl1-6
# from an idea communicated by S. Scholtes.
#
# This is almost a sensible problem. Here, ask what 
# vector r of minimum norm perturbations to returns R, 
# gives a solution that is as close as possible to the 
# given solution (obtained by rounding soln to portfl1-6).
#
# Problem has data files portfl1.dat - portfl6.dat with
# different parameters F & R.
